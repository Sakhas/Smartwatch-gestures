	<h1>Samsung Gear S release date, price and specs UK: Smartwatch coming on 7 November at £329</h1>
	<h2 style="color:orange">Samsung's Gear S curved-screen smartwatch works independently of a smartphone, and is now available to pre-order in the UK</h2>
	  		
	<p>
		Samsung has officially confirmed its curved-screen Samsung Gear S (aka Solo) smartwatch, which has Bluetooth, wireless and 3G connectivity and can work independently of a smartphone. Here's everything you need to know about the Samsung Gear S release date, price and specs UK. Updated on 05/11/14. Also see: Samsung Galaxy Note 4 release date, price and specs UK.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Samsung Gear S: Release date and price UK </h2>
	
	<p>
		Samsung initially said the Gear S would go on sale in October but has now said it will be available from 7 November starting with Samsung Experience Stores, Samsung.com Shop and O2. The Samsung Gear S price has finally been confirmed, with Mobile Fun listing it at £329. This has now been confirmed as the RRP by Samsung.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Samsung Gear S: specs</h2>
	
	<p>
		Rather than Android Wear the Samsung Gear S runs the Tizen OS. It also comes preinstalled with Nokia's HERE Maps app and the Financial Times' fastFT app.

The Samsung Gear S, available in black or white, has a 2in curved screen, which allows it to fit comfortably around the wrist.

It also supports Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and 3G, so you don't need a smartphone to receive notifications, which will likely appeal to fitness enthusiasts who don't want to carry a smartphone when they work out. A down side to this is shorter battery life from the internal 300mAh cell - around two days, according to Samsung.

Other features include a heart-rate scanner and, according to Sammobile, a UV sensor. The Gear S will run a 1GHz dual-core processor, 512MB of RAM and have 4GB of internal storage.

The Samsung Gear S offers IP67-rated dust- and waterproof protection.

	<h2>Samsung round smartwatch</h2>
	
	<p>
		While the Samsung Gear S follows a rectangular design, Samsung is also working on a round smartwatch (pictured below). This smartwatch will be Samsung's answer to the Motorola Moto G and LG G Watch R, but we're still waiting to hear more details on it.

		<h1>Hands on: Apple Watch review</h1>
		<h2 style="color: orange">Apple finally attacks the wrist</h2>
		
		<p>Most of us expected the Apple Watch to appear in 2015, but it made a (semi) surprise launch alongside the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.

			And we've now seen it in more depth at Apple's special launch event, with all the variants on display and a little more info on the bits you might not have seen.
			
			The Apple Watch release date has been set for April 24, with pre-orders going live on April 10.
			
			This means the September launch was a deliberate ploy by Apple to make sure you weren't buying a Samsung, LG or Moto 360 option in the run up to Christmas.
			
			But there's a pretty good reason for most to hang on – this is a very stylish wearable indeed. 
		</p>
		
		<p>Apple's clearly aiming this at the fashion market as much as the person who loves to be an early adopter – given the smartwatch market is still yet to take off, it makes sense to focus further afield in terms of consumer targeting.

			It also packs NFC, allowing it to be used as part of the new Apple Pay system - something that's either going to be really helpful or a big turn off to some.
			
			But essentially this is a product that defines a new chapter for Apple. Well, that's if it's any good, of course.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Design</h2>
		
		<p>
			The Apple Watch is coming in six different versions: there's the Apple Watch, the Apple Watch Sport and the Apple Watch Edition. And each of these comes in two sizes, for those that like a larger or smaller device for their wrist.
			
			In terms of combinations with straps, that's a whopping 38 options - and we've rounded them all up here.

			 can't call it a lady or man's watch, but there will be those that do, and it's opened Apple up to a new market in doing so.

			While I expected it to be rounded, the fact is the Apple Watch looks like a small fusion between iPhone 6 and iPod Nano. It's not unattractive, but it is on the chunkier side of things.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			It's rounded at the sides, which works in its favour, and the very slightly curved back makes it feel nice, if a little heavy (depending on the band) on the wrist.

			The Edition... edition is a properly heavy device though. It's one that will look great but feel like you've spent a thousand dollars on it. Actually, that's bang on the money: it will cost up to $17,000 (£13,500, AU$24,000). Ouch.

			The design is basically saying 'money money money MONEY' as even the sports band, the basic rubber strap you use to stop sweat destroying your leather has a gold pin.
		</p>
		
		<h1>Interface</h1>
		<p>
			The interface is curious, but I really think Apple has done better than most with the way it's approached interacting with a wrist-dwelling device.

			The Digital Crown is essentially a scroll wheel that lets you zoom in and out of the interface, so for apps (with a fun new home screen that looks NOTHING like the iPhone's version, more a spherical look at all the apps available on the watch) it's a new way of doing things.

			The spherical interface is going to take some getting used to. The demos I saw showed a slightly tricky method of hitting the right area to open the app you want, leading to needing to use the Digital Crown more often than not.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			It's got a very smooth action when twisted and pressed, where I expected it to be a clicking feel (just because that's what you get with a watch). It will be interesting to see if this becomes embedded as a way of using the Watch, but anything that takes away from having to touch the screen will be a good thing.

			Tapping the crown inwards sends you back to the home screen, but you can also use the touchscreen on the Watch to to interact with apps.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The button below the Digital Crown serves two functions: one to take you to your contacts, and the other to work as a way into activating the Watch as a payment vehicle.

			The contacts app is interesting, as it allows you to send things through to your friends that go beyond the normal messaging paradigm. And it's been updated: it's now a circular dial to track through your best buddies, and it works a lot better than just tapping their faces in rows.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			That said, the Apple Watch is adept at doing the basic smartwatch things: you can make and receive calls from your wrist (with mic and speaker) and it will scan messages coming in to work out if it can generate an easy response for you to tap.

			So if someone asks 'Fish or Chips for dinner?' the Watch will ask you to tap Fish or Chips as a reply. Although if it's really smart, it will offer both as an option. Because everyone loves fish and chips.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Beyond that though, you can send some really weird things. For instance, you can draw pictures and send them over (although let's be honest, you're going to be getting lots of pictures of male genitalia from your friends sent to your wrist when you're presenting) or a vibration code that you've predefined with a pal.

Or you can even hit the screen with two fingers to send over a heart rate image, which vibrates on that person's arm. The graphic is kind of intense - but it doesn't explain why Apple has offered this.
